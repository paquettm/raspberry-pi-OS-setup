# Viewing HEIC files in UBUNTU

Xviewer is the default image viewer of Linux Mint Cinnamon Edition. It’s based on GNOME’s gdk-pixbuf library, also used by Eye of GNOME, GPicView, PCMan File Manager, Nemo File Manager, and other applications.

All it takes is to install the heif-gdk-pixbuf package to enable HEIC support in all these programs:

`sudo apt install heif-gdk-pixbuf`

Restart your session to see thumbnails in yoiur file manager.
